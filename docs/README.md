# Scare the Crow

Scare the Crow is my implementation of the classic word game, [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>). Halloween is right around the corner so I wanted to combine that theme with the story of how, at one point in my life, a crow in my neighborhood used to dive-bomb me for no apparent reason!

The objective of this game is to guess the randomly picked secret word using 6 or less guesses. The user plays the role of a scarecrow with 6 HP (hit points or health points). Each time the player guesses incorrectly, the crow dive-bombs the scarecrow, dealing damage equivalent to 1 HP. If the user guesses the secret word correctly, with HP remaining, the scarecrow successfully scares the crow away! If not, the crow defeats the scarecrow!
